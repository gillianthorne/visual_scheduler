# Daily Visual Schedule & To‑Do App  
A Flutter + Hive productivity app designed for minute‑level planning, overlapping tasks, reusable templates, and customizable visual schedules.

This project serves two purposes:
1. A real tool I use to plan my day.
2. A polished portfolio project demonstrating Flutter architecture, state management, and local persistence with Hive.

## ✨ Features

### 🕒 Minute‑Level Scheduling
- Plan tasks down to the minute (or 5‑minute increments).
- Smooth, scrollable daily timeline.

### 🔁 Overlapping Tasks
- Schedule tasks that run concurrently (e.g., laundry during homework).
- Layered visual representation for clarity.

### 🎨 Customizable Colors & Categories
- Full color picker for categories and tasks.
- Visual organization that adapts to your workflow.

### 📦 Reusable Templates
- Create preset blocks (e.g., “3‑hour class”, “Doctor’s appointment”, “Study block”).
- Drag‑and‑drop into your schedule.

### 📅 Custom Day Profiles
- Save entire day layouts (e.g., “Wednesday class schedule”).
- Apply profiles to future dates.

### 📆 Plan Ahead
- Add tasks to any future day.
- Weekly and monthly views for long‑term planning.

- Task creation UI  

### Phase 3 — Templates & Profiles
- Template library  
- Day profile system  
- Apply profiles to future days  

### Phase 4 — UI Polish
- Animations  
- Color picker  
- Themes (light/dark/pastel)  

### Phase 5 — Portfolio Polish
